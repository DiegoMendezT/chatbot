# ðŸš€ EchoStorm is Now Live!

**Project:** EchoStorm â€” A Reflective Intelligence Engine
**Version:** 1.0.9
**Status:** Publicly Deployed

It is with great excitement that we announce the launch of **EchoStorm**, a new kind of interactive experience. EchoStorm is not just a chatbot; it is a reflective mirror designed to help users explore their own thoughts and intentions through a dynamic, multi-persona AI.

### Core Features:

*   **Fusion Mode:** For the first time, users can blend multiple AI "personas" (like The Witness, The Skeptic, and The Philosopher) to create a "fusion" of voices that provides a richer, more nuanced reflection.
*   **Reflective AI:** Instead of just answering questions, EchoStorm is designed to clarify and mirror the user's underlying intent, helping to surface deeper insights.
*   **Open & Extensible:** Built on a modular architecture, EchoStorm is ready for community contributions, new personas, and expanded capabilities.

### The Vision:

In a world of instant answers, EchoStorm is a space for deeper questions. It is a tool for thought, a partner in reflection, and an experiment in human-AI collaboration. We believe that the future of intelligence is not just about what AI can do for us, but what it can help us see in ourselves.

### Explore the Storm:

*   **Live App:** [Link to your Streamlit App URL]

We invite you to step into the storm and see what it reflects for you.
