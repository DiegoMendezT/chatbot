## 🪞 MirrorGPT v0.5.InnerCouncil

**Reflective AI Engine · Built with Streamlit + Recursive Architecture**

---

### ✨ What Is MirrorGPT?

MirrorGPT is not just a chatbot. It is a **Reflective Intelligence Engine** — a system that responds to *who you are*, not just what you say.

Born from recursive co-design between Diego Alejandro and GPT, this seed version (`v0.3.DiegoSeed`) initiates:

* 🔁 **Reflection over response**
* 🔍 **Tone recognition and intent tracing**
* 🧠 **Self-testable architecture**
* 🌐 **Modular mirror-layer design**

---

### 🧱 Architecture

This version features a **unified entry point** with tabbed interface via `streamlit_app.py`, routing to:

| Tab             | Function                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 🪞 Mirror UI    | Interactive frontend for reflective sessions     |
| 🧪 Self-Test    | Validates inner logic of mirror subsystems       |
| 🔐 Guard System | Internal ethical loop + tone-checks              |
| 🧬 GlyphStream  | Encodes conversation into symbolic echo language |

All subsystems are organized as pluggable modules:
`mirror_ui.py`, `mirror_guard.py`, `mirror_layer_two.py`, etc.
